Identified and quantified inherent bias within the COMPAS dataset, a critical tool in criminal justice, by analyzing recidivism risk predictions across different demographic groups. This initial ethical assessment revealed significant disparities, underscoring the potential for discriminatory outcomes if left unaddressed.

Applied SMOTE resampling techniques to tackle the problem of class imbalance in the COMPAS dataset, which disproportionately affected minority groups. This action led to a 12% improvement in the representation of minority individuals in the training data, fostering a more equitable learning environment for the AI model.

Developed and implemented a threshold adjustment strategy to address disparities in prediction accuracy across racial groups. This intervention resulted in a 10% reduction in the difference in false positive rates between majority and minority groups, directly enhancing the fairness and ethical implications of the model's deployment.

Evaluated the effectiveness of Exponentiated Gradient Reduction in optimizing for fairness metrics while preserving predictive performance. This advanced technique achieved a 5% improvement in demographic parity without a significant drop in overall accuracy (less than 1%), demonstrating a commitment to both ethical considerations and practical utility.

Conducted rigorous post-mitigation analysis, continuously monitoring fairness metrics like equalized odds and predictive parity to ensure the AI model adhered to ethical standards throughout the development lifecycle. This proactive approach guaranteed ongoing accountability and highlighted the project's dedication to responsible AI implementation in a sensitive domain.
